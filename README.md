# Music Box ðŸ“»
Music box is a simple music player web app. Check out a hosted version [here](https://joshuaobrien.github.io/music-box-submission/)!

### What features does it have?
Really, it has one feature: playing music! Search for anything you want, and if it's in the iTunes library you'll be able to listen to a preview of it. It's responsive, too, so don't be afraid to resize that window a bit!

### Which browsers are supported?
Just recent versions of Chrome at the moment.
